# Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard is a web application that allows administrators to search, view, edit, and delete users from a centralized dashboard.

## Installation

To install and run the Admin Dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LUKARS3/geektrust-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd admin-dashboard-geektrust
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```

   The Admin Dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Usage

Once the Admin Dashboard is up and running, administrators can perform the following actions:

- Search: Administrators can search for specific users using various search criteria such as name, email, or username.

- View: The dashboard displays a list of users, providing relevant information such as their name, email, and role. Administrators can view detailed information about individual users by clicking on their profile.

- Edit: Administrators have the ability to edit user details, such as their role, permissions, or contact information. Changes made will be saved and reflected in the system.

- Delete: Administrators can remove users from the system entirely by selecting the delete option. A confirmation prompt will ensure that the action is intentional.

Please note that only authorized administrators with proper authentication and access privileges can access and use the Admin Dashboard.
